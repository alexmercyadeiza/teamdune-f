## Problem statement:
How eNaira can be adopted by SMEs and startups to create innovative products or enhance their existing services.

## Solution:
We are making it easier for SMEs to accept payments locally and internationally, by creating stores, payment links and integrating our eNaira powered checkout page on their existing websites, whilst reducing/eliminating transaction costs for users.

## What we have done:
1. Created an eNaira API based checkout card to make it easier for businesses to accept payments from users on their existing websites.

2. Merchants can create instant eNaira powered payment links for products or services.

3. Merchants/businesses can create an eCommerce store with the eNaira checkout option by default to sell products.

## What's left to do:
1. Enabling businesses/merchants transfer money or pay other merchants.

2. A physical & virtual card to allow businesses to spend from their eNaira wallets increasing access to liquidity.

3. Receive international payments directly to merchant e-naira accounts.
